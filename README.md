# My ChatGpt WebApp

This application was developed using ReactJS and the OpenAI API, with the help of ChatGPT3, an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI, which provided 60% of the source code. The remaining 40% was written by me, using my limited knowledge of ReactJS, which I am still learning.

I hope it can be useful to someone.

Peace.
